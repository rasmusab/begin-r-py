This is a short 1-2h introduction to the R programming language and was made by me, [Rasmus Bååth](https://www.sumsar.net/about/). It's aimed at people who never tried out R before and is meant to give you a _feeling_ for what programming in R is and what R can do. If you use it in a course, please do send me a message (`rasmus.baath@gmail.com`) and let me know how it went.

This introduction was made possible thanks to the [quarto](https://quarto.org/), [webr](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/), and [quarto-live](https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/) projects. The full source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/rasmusab/begin-r-py).
