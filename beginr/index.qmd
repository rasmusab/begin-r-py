R is a powerful programming language for data analysis and statistics. 

But let's start simple. Out-of-the-box R can do everything you'd expect a calculator to do. 

Here's a code cell where you can put in any R code you want. But for now, let's just add two numbers together and then press **â–¶ Run Code**.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex1
#| startover: false

```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex1
#| check: true
if(is.numeric(.result)) {
  list(correct = TRUE, message = "That sure looks like a number to me!")
} else {
  list(correct = FALSE, message = "Try adding two numbers, say 19 + 23.")
}
```
