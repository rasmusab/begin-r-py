Out-of-the-box R can do everything you’d expect a calculator to do.\nHere’s a code cell where you can put in any R code you want. But for now, let’s just add two numbers together and then press ▶ Run Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut wait, there’s also other datatypes! Try writing a string in the code cell below and then press ▶ Run Code. Tip: Use double quotes to define a string, like this: \"Hello, World!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat work. Now go to the next chapter!",
