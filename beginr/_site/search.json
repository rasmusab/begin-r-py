    "text": "Restart chapter \n\n\nCreating vectors, 1:5, c(), etc. and also introduce the concept of variables.\nSimple vectorized example. 1:5 ^\nAssignment\n\n\nLast chapter we saw an example of a vector: A sequence of data of the same type, for example, a sequence of numbers or a sequence of strings. When analyzing data, you almost never deal with single numbers, and the reason you need to analyze the data in the first place is likely because there are heaps of it! That‚Äôs why handling sequences of strings and numbers are central to data analysis and why vectors are core to R.\nLet me show you how central vectors are to R.\n\nType any number in the box below and press ‚ñ∂ Run Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it‚Äôs not just a number. It‚Äôs actually a one-item vector, with a single number. In R, even single numbers are vectors.\nSometimes, you would want to create new vectors longer that a single number. This can be done using the c() function that combines many values. For example, c(2, 3, 5, 7, 9) will create a numeric vector with all prime numbers between 1 and 10.\n\nCreate a numeric vector using c() with at least 5 items. (Btw, I‚Äôll check if any of them are prime numbers.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many functions that help you create vectors in R, one shortcut is the colon operator where, say, 10:30 would create the vector 10, 11, 12, ..., 28, 29, 30.\n\nUse the colon : operator to create the vector 1, 2, 3, ..., 98, 99, 100. (I‚Äôll, again, figure out which are prime.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany functions in R are vectorized, that is, they work both on single values, as well as vectors. For example, nchar(\"pizza\") returns 5, the number of characters in \"pizza\". But nchar() also works on vectors of strings.\n\nUse nchar() to count the number of characters in each word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, especially, all math operators (+, *, etc.) are vectorized.\n\nMake the below output the vector c(15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105) by only changing the numbers in * 1 + 0 (leave 1:10 alone!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat work!

    "text": "Restart chapter \n\n\nR is a powerful programming language that excels at data analysis and statistics. But really, it can do almost anything!\nBut let‚Äôs start simple: Out-of-the-box R can do everything you‚Äôd expect a calculator to do. Here‚Äôs a code cell where you can put in any R code you want.\n\nBut for now, just add two numbers together and press ‚ñ∂ Run Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends of +, like -, /, and * work as expected. R also includes a large number of mathematical functions, like log(), exp(), and sqrt(). To call a function you write its name followed by the argument between parentheses, like log(2.72) or sin(1.57).\n\nCalculate the square root of 1764 using sqrt().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions can have more than one argument, which, are, then, separated, by, commas. For example, max(1, 3, 5, 4, 2) returns the highest of it‚Äôs arguments: 5. Another function that can take many arguments is sum().\n\nUse sum() to sum up several large numbers, I don‚Äôt care which, but they should total more than 1,000,000!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR can work with more than numbers and there are many other types of data, or data types, in R. A piece of text, often called a string, is written by putting the text ‚Äúinto quotes‚Äù.\n\nTry writing a string, any string, in the code cell below. I‚Äôll repeat it three times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike with numbers, you can also apply functions to strings. For example, tolower() turns all characters into lower case.\n\nWe‚Äôre in a library. Use tolower() on the string to get the upset person to calm down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, there are functions that take both numbers and strings as arguments. But the order of the arguments is important! For example, for rep() the first argument is the value to repeat, and the second argument is the number of repetitions.\n\nRepeat a moderately dirty word a 100 times using rep().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might not be obvious, but the result above is actually a list of 100 strings. That‚Äôs why there are [ ] with numbers showing the index of the right-most elements. In R, lists where all elements are of the same data type are called vectors (to confuse you, there‚Äôs also something else called a list in R, but that‚Äôs for another time).\nI‚Äôve gone ahead and created a numeric vector for you. It‚Äôs called temp and contains the max C¬∞ temperature in Hyderabad, India for each day in June 2023 (source). In R you can print out a representation of whatever you want to look at by simply writing its name.\n\nTake a look at the data in temp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, there are 30 days in June, right? Are there really 30 temperatures in temp?\n\nUse the length() function to count the number of elements in temp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what was the highest temperature in Hyderabad in June 2023?\n\nUse max() to get the highest value in temp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt 42.4 C¬∞ every day, I hope. What was the mean temperature?\n\nUse, you guessed it, mean() to get the mean/average of temp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you‚Äôve seen, there are many things you can do, once you‚Äôve gotten some data into R. One thing that‚Äôs always nice to do with new data is to plot it!\n\nUse plot() to make a simple time-series plot of temp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR is great for making beautiful plots, but that usually takes a bit more effort. But, as the last exercise in this chapter, let‚Äôs spiff up this plot, just a little bit!\nMany functions in R can be given optional arguments, and plot() has many that change the appearance of the plot. Arguments to a function can also be given in the form the_argument_name = \"the value\", and then the argument order doesn‚Äôt matter anymore.\n\nFor the plot arguments below, replace ______ between the \"\" to your liking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat work!
