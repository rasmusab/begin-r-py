But really, it can do almost anything!\nBut let’s start simple: Out-of-the-box R can do everything you’d expect a calculator to do. Here’s a code cell where you can put in any R code you want.\n\nBut for now, just add two numbers together and press ▶ Run Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends of +, like -, /, and * works like expected. R also includes a large number of mathematical functions, like log, exp, and sqrt. To call a function you write it’s name followed by the argument between parentheses, like log(2.72) or sin(1.57).\n\nCalculate the square root of 1764.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions can have more than one argument, which, are, then, separated, by, commas. For example, max(1, 3, 5, 4, 2) returns the highest of it’s arguments: 5. Another function that can take many arguments is sum\n\nUse sum to sum up several large numbers, I don’t care which, but they should total more than 1,000,000!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR can work with more than numbers and there are many other types of data, or data types, in R. A pieces of text, often called a string, is written by putting the text “into quotes”.\n\nTry writing a string, any string, in the code cell below. I promise I’ll repeat it three times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike with numbers, you can also apply functions to strings. For example, tolower() turns all characters into lower case.\n\nWe’re in a library. Use tolower on the string to get the upset person to calm down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat work. Now go to the next chapter!",
