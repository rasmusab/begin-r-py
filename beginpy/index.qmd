Python is a powerful programming language for data analysis and statistics. 

But let's start simple. Out-of-the-box Python can do everything you'd expect a calculator to do. 

Here's a code cell where you can put in any Python code you want. But for now, let's just add two numbers together and then press **â–¶ Run Code**.

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: ex1
#| startover: false

```

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: ex1
#| check: true
import numbers
if isinstance(result, numbers.Number):
  feedback = {"correct": True, "message": "That sure looks like a number to me!"}
else:
  feedback = {"correct": False, "message": "Try adding two numbers, say 19 + 23."}
  print("Try adding two numbers, say 19 + 23.")
feedback
```
